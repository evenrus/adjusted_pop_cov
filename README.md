# Adjusted population coverage
A method to estimate population coverage for a set of epitopes adjusted for immunoprevalence

Developed by Torfinn St√∏ve Madssen and Even Holth Rustad

Accompanying the manuscript: Prevalent and immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 variants (Meyer, Blaas, Bollineni, et al.) 

The enclosed Rmd and data files are sufficient to reproduce the analysis and figures shown in the paper. All analyses should run in < 5 minutes on a standard computer, provided the required R packages are installed.
